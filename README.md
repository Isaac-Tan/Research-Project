## Abstract

Weed management plays a crucial role in the outcome of harvests across the industry of agriculture. Through advancements in software systems, more emphasis is being placed on the optimisation of weed management and how emerging technologies can be used to reduce labour, reduce chemical contamination, and increase profitability of agriculture. This project investigates the use of a convolutional neural network in the task of identifying and segmenting weeds in images of grass for the future task of automatically precision spraying weeds. The neural network was built upon the U-Net architecture and the results of this project aimed to compare the accuracy and speed of different constraints on the architecture and asses the overall viability for a segmentation system using this architecture. Findings showed that system resulted in accuracies up to 86.5% and taking at maximum 1.69 seconds to segment a dataset of 135 images 256x256 pixels in size. 

The progress on this project thus far can be seen in _Progress Report.pdf_. The progress in the first semester focussed on semantic segmentation of the dataset, while semester two will focus on classifcation.
